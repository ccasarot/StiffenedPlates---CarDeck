# StiffenedPlates---CarDeck
Static analysis of the car deck of a ferry 

# Description
This repository contains the first project from the course "41517 Stiffened Plates and Sandwich Constructions" (DTU, spring semester). This course deals with the design of plate-like components such as stiffened plates, mainly employed in the naval industry and heavy metal constructions, and stiffened plates mainly used for light applications in the aeronautical sector. The design of such components is, of course, mainly done through FEM, but analytical solutions exist for relatively simple problems through Navier's method (Exact solution) and Energy-based methods, giving approximate solutions.

The first project, stored in this repository, deals with the design of the deck panel of a car ferry. One can consult the "Assignment" file to have more information about the nature of the project and the "Report" to view the study outcome. All the MATLAB implementation of the methods used throughout the study is collected in the dedicated folder.

This project was developed in collaboration with another student, Irene Berganzo, from DTU Mechanical Engineering.
